Distro change log


07-Sep-2015	Yukiko	Fixed:		nlootgroup.cfg had the word "Potion" appended to the end of some potions in the "Group Potions" section. The potions defined in \pkg\skills\alchemy don't have "Potion" as part of their name. This was causing "unable to create" errors on console.

07-Sep-2015	Yukiko	Fixed:		In \pkg\commands\include\goText.inc some of the MoveObjectToLocation calls had the realm parameter inside a CInt() function.
					
18-Oct-2015	Yukiko	Moved:		Relocated custom defined objects above the 0xFFFF graphic area to prevent conflicts with expanded graphics in the latest (High Seas) client. Basically I just added 0x10000 to the old ObjType number. Added "OldObjType" directive to the definitions of items that were moved. Checked and updated SRC, INC, and CFG files for references ObjType numbers of moved items. There still might be some things I missed.

19-Dec-2015	Yukiko 	Fixed:		Folder and file name references with mixed (mismatched) case were causing issues on Linux.

21-Dec-2015	Yukiko	Added:		The HSA Galleon ships that were supposed to be included before. Note that there are some incomplete parts that need to be programmed. You are able to command the ships if you can get onboard. However, the ability to get on and get off the ships isn't working correctly. The storage holds are not yet scripted. The weapons slots are not scripted.

23-Dec-2015	Yukiko	Added:		gmform (changes your graphic to 0x3db - allows you to walk through doors) and myform (returns your graphic to your trueobjtype) commands.

23-Dec-2015	Yukiko	Added:		Privileges that have been added to the Core since POL 0.97.

23-Dec-2015	Yukiko	Fixed:		There were a few scripts that were using the old ObjType number for a static house sign; recall.src, gate.src, staticdeed.src, and housing.inc.

23-Dec-2015	Yukiko	Added:		Static housing documentation in the \docs\Additional Docs directory. It's far from complete but for now it explains how to deed out a house.

24-Dec-2015	Yukiko	Fixed:		A lot of file name case mismatch issues for Linux. There were several commits over the next few days fixing more case mismatch issues.

28-Dec-2015	Yukiko	Changed:	The createnpc command to notify the user if they were creating an NPC that requires a listening node. The script now presents a gump telling the user that they are about to create the NPC that requires a node. The script will then create a guard node or start the createnode script as needed.

28-Dec-2015	Yukiko	Added:		Intrinsic shield item to the itemdesc.cfg file in \pkg\systems\combat.

29-Dec-2015	Yukiko	Fixed:		The staticSignControl script. It was ignoring the Z coordinate for house commands. This created a problem if a room on an upper or lower floor was deeded out because the house commands would still work if the owner was above or below the part of the structure they actually owned. This change allows for the rooms on different floors of an inn for example to be sold to players. Also changed the way the staticdeed command works. Now you need to target the North-West corner of the highest floor of a structure when deeding it.

30-Dec-2015	Yukiko	Fixed:		A math bug in the staticdeed command that wasn't figuring the price for upper levels correctly.

30-Dec-2015	Yukiko	Moved:		The price modifier for multi-stories to the settings file in the housing package.

05-Jan-2016	Yukiko Updated:		I rewrote the createnpc command adding a gump display if the user doesn't specify an NPC template when entering the command. From the user's standpoint it works just like the World of Dreams command. It uses the NPC_Groups.cfg file to look-up the images for the gumps. When adding new NPCs to the server you will have to add them to the NPC_Groups file. I renamed the old createnpc.src file to old_createnpc.src. This is not completed as of June 2017.

05-Jan-2016	Yukiko	Fixed:		The appraiser.src AI program. In making the Distro compatible with High Seas graphics I had moved the ObjType numbers for multi-deeds above the 0xFFFF range by adding 0x10000 to any custom objects that occupied the 0x4000 to 0xFFFF range. In the appraiser AI the numbers for deeds are hard coded and needed updating which I did.

06-Jan-2016	Yukiko	Added:		I added some new NPCs to the Distro. Sorry but I didn't make a list of the new ones.

07-Jan-2016	Yukiko	Removed:	I removed the line in the onCreate.src file that moved a newly created player character to Vesper. I don't remember putting that in there. So I commented it out.

07-Jan-2016	Yukiko	Removed:	I removed the ignoredoors privilege setting from the info command because it has no effect.

07-Jan-2016	Yukiko	Updated:	I upodated the NPC_Groups file to include NPCs that require nodes. Had to make a change to the createnpc command tto accomodate the node NPCs being added to the selection menu.

10-Jan-2016	Yukiko	Fixed:		Town Guards were oblivious to baddies if they suddenly appeared within their range of protection, ie. createnpc'ed baddies were ignored. That has been fixed. They will also call for help from other guards to assist.

10-Jan-2016	Yukiko	Fixed:		Bug in staticdeed.src. Calculations for number of lockdowns and secures were wrong. The program always returned 0 for each one and thus the minimum default was always given for lockdowns and secures.

10-Jan-2016	Yukiko	Fixed:		Fixed minor bug in staticSign.src that was using a constant for house decay rather than getting decay time fro housing settings file.

10-Jan-2016	Yukiko	Updated:	Continuing to update and expand the docs for the Distro. In this case static housing docs were worked on.

10-Jan-2016	Yukiko	Moved:		\pkg\skills\alchemy\potion.inc and \pkg\skills\alchemy\drinkPotion.inc to \pkg\skills\alchemy\include\ directory.

11-Jan-2016	Yukiko	Fixed:		Several "include" statements in programs in the alchemy package had improper path format.

12-Jan-2016	Yukiko	Moved:		Fixed a lot of organizational issues. Config files in main package directories were moved to the config folders in the package. Same with include files moved to include folders in the packages. I think I corrected any issues with include paths in files affected.

08-Dec-2016	Yukiko	Added		Realmgen support for Termur.

10-Dec-2016	Yukiko	Added		Linux shell files added. starthere.sh and a folder containing additional *.sh files.

15-Apr-2017	Yukiko	Fixed		Some boat items and mount objtype numbers were still in the 0xFFxx range.

15-Apr-2017	Yukiko	Fixed		Boat hold objtype needed moved to 0x1FFxx range.

07-May-2017	Yukiko	Added		Ridables to be TOL compliant. Still need to add proper stats and skill to them.

16-May-2017	Yukiko	Changed		All custom items have been moved to the 0x10000-0xiFFFF range. Scripts that used the old objtype numbers have been updated.

26-May-2017	Yukiko	Fixed		I missed one reference in Alchemy pkg to an item that was in the 0xDCxx range that now exists in the 0x1DCxx range.

08-Jun-2017	Yukiko	Added		Elements to regions.cfg to specify currency used in a city. Also added the 'Type' element to specify the type of the region.
					Currently only 'Type city' is used. Currency types are 0xEED - gold, 0xEF0 - silver, and 0xEEA - copper.

08-Jun-2017	Yukiko	Added		A new package called 'currency'. Added silver and copper coin definitions and moved gold coins from blacksmithy itemdesc to
					currency package. Added Banker's Draft item to currency/config/itemdesc.cfg. This is an ingame cheque actually but I was
					trying to find an old fashioned name for cheques :).
08--Jun-2017	Yukiko	Added		Functionality to findCity.inc to read regions.cfg for city boundaries, the Type, and Currency elements.

08-Jun-2017	Yukiko	Added		Some additional functions to a few includes, some of which are :accounts:accounts.inc, scripts/include/string.inc,
					findCity.inc in the same directory. I think that covers it.

08-Jun-2017	Yukiko	Added		New features to banker.src in scripts/ai. When you request your balance it is no longer delivered as text but is displayed
					in a gump. The gump shows the balance of gold coins, silver ocoins (if you have any), and copper coins (if you have any)
					in your account. The other feature is the banker can now sell Banker's Orders (cheques) that you buy to use instead of
					carrying around huge amounts of coin. The speech command is "bankers order" or "banker's order". He will ask you to wait
					a moment(2 seconds) while he pulls out the ledger. That wait time can be removed if you want to but I thought it added
					to the RP value. Then you are presented with a gump to enter the amount of the cheque. The maximum is 500,000,000 coins.
					You can cancel by leaving it blank or the usual right-click method. Then you are asked to enter the payee's name.
					Be sure to spell it correctly. The script will then search to see if there is a player by that name. Assuming there is
					you will be presented with a 'yes/no' gump telling you that it will cost an additional ten coins for the cheque. If you
					agrre the cheque will be put in your backpack and the coins extracted from your bank box. The total amount of coins,
					including the 10 additional for the cost of the Banker's Order must be in your bank.

					The process of redeeming a cheque is easy. The payee simply drops it on the banker. They get a gump asking if they wish
					to redeem it and if so the coins are deposited in their bank. The purchaser also has the option of cancelling the cheque
					if they have it in their possession by the same method. If you cancel it the 10 coins you used to purchase it are not
					refundable. :) All approprite checks are made against full backpacks and bank boxes and the transactions will be cancelled
					if there is no room for the cheque in the purchaser's pack or the coins to be deposited in the bank. No money will be
					taken in that case and if redeeming the cheque fails because the bank box is full the cheque will be return to the player's
					backpack.
